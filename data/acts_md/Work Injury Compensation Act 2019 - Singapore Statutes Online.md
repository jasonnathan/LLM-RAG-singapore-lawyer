### 28. Insurer’s obligation if employer bankrupt, etc.

    (1)  Despite any written law relating to bankruptcy or the winding up of companies, where an employer has entered into a contract with any insurer in respect of any liability under this Act to any employee, the rights of the employer under the contract against the insurer in respect of that liability are transferred to and vest in the employee in any of the following events:

      (a) the same rights and remedies in relation to the employee as if the insurer were the employer; and
      (b) the same liabilities in relation to the employee as if the insurer were the employer, but this does not impose on the insurer any greater liability to the employee than the insurer’s liability to the employer under the contract.
    (3)  If the insurer’s liability to the employee under subsection (2)(b) is less than the liability of the employer to the employee, the employee may, as the case may be —
      (a) prove for the balance in the employer’s bankruptcy or liquidation; or
      (b) recover the balance from the receiver or manager of the employer’s business or undertaking.
    (4)  Where the employer’s liability is to pay periodical payments for temporary incapacity —
      (a) the amount payable in respect of the compensation, for the purposes of this section, is the lump sum into which the employer’s liability to pay the periodical payments for temporary incapacity could, if commutable, be commuted under section 17(4); and
      (b) a certificate of the Commissioner as to the amount of the lump sum is conclusive proof of that amount.

    (3)  Where, despite the contract mentioned in section 28(1) being void or voidable, the insurer pays any amount to the employee in respect of the employer’s liability to pay compensation under this Act, the insurer is entitled to —
      (a) prove for the relevant amount in the employer’s bankruptcy or liquidation; or
      (b) recover the relevant amount from the receiver or manager of the employer’s business or undertaking.
    (4)  The relevant amount mentioned in subsection (3) is the amount paid, excluding (where the contract is void or voidable only in part) the amount that the insurer is still liable to pay under any part of the contract that is not void or voidable.
