### 8. Grant of Aid

    (1)  The Director may approve an application for legal aid, and issue a Grant of Aid to an applicant in connection with any proceedings, if —
      (a) the Director is of the opinion that the applicant satisfies the prescribed means criteria; and
      (b) either of the following applies:(i)in any case where those proceedings are prescribed proceedings or belong to a prescribed class of proceedings — the Director is of the opinion that the applicant has reasonable grounds for taking, defending, continuing or being a party to those proceedings;(ii)in any other case — a board (consisting of the Director and at least 2 solicitors on an appropriate panel of solicitors maintained under section 4) is of the opinion that the applicant has reasonable grounds for taking, defending, continuing or being a party to those proceedings.[50/2018]
        (i) in any case where those proceedings are prescribed proceedings or belong to a prescribed class of proceedings — the Director is of the opinion that the applicant has reasonable grounds for taking, defending, continuing or being a party to those proceedings; (ii) in any other case — a board (consisting of the Director and at least 2 solicitors on an appropriate panel of solicitors maintained under section 4) is of the opinion that the applicant has reasonable grounds for taking, defending, continuing or being a party to those proceedings.[50/2018]
    (2)  Pending the determination of an application under subsection (1), the Director may despite that subsection approve an application for legal aid, and issue a Grant of Aid on a provisional basis to an applicant in connection with any proceedings, if the Director is of the opinion that the applicant —

    (4)  Despite any provision of this Act (including any regulations made under this Act), the Minister may —
      (a) authorise the Director to issue a Grant of Aid to any person in connection with any proceedings, if the Minister is of the opinion that it is in the public interest that legal aid be granted to the person in that connection; and
      (b) direct the Director to approve an application for legal aid, and issue a Grant of Aid under subsection (1) or (2) to an applicant, even though the Director is of the opinion that the applicant does not satisfy, or is not likely to satisfy, the prescribed means criteria, if the Minister is of the opinion that it is just and proper that legal aid be granted to the applicant.[50/2018]
    (5)  For the purposes of subsection (4)(b), the Minister may authorise any person (including a panel of persons), with such qualifications and experience as the Minister considers appropriate in relation to assessing the financial circumstances of an applicant, to exercise the power under that subsection.

    (5)  Subject to sections 13 and 22A, no person who, pursuant to any reference under this Act, makes any investigation or report or gives any opinion or who pursuant to any assignment under this Act conducts any proceedings may take or agree to take or seek from an aided person any fee, profit or reward (pecuniary or otherwise) in respect of the making of such investigation or report, the giving of such opinion, or the conduct of such proceedings.

      [6/2013]
    (4)  In any case where the Director is satisfied that the making of a deposit under subsection (1) would occasion hardship, the Director may, out of any funds in the Director’s control which are available for the purpose, from time to time, meet any out‑of‑pocket expenses (not including office expenses) or make such advances to meet such out‑of‑pocket expenses as the Director may consider necessary.
    (5)  Any advance so made must be used only for payment of such out‑of‑pocket expenses and any part of such amount not so expended must be refunded to the Director.
    (6)  Where the Director has made any advance out of the funds in the Director’s control to meet out‑of‑pocket expenses under subsection (4), the Director may require the applicant or the aided person (as the case may be) in respect of whom those expenses are incurred to repay to the Director any amount expended or advanced in any manner that the Director thinks fit.

  [6/2013]

### 22. Privileges attaching to certain relationships

    (1)  The like privileges and rights as those which arise from the relationship of client and solicitor acting in the solicitor’s professional employment are to arise from the following relationships:

      (b) the relationship between an aided person and the Director and the solicitor (if any) assigned to act for the aided person in any proceedings to which a Grant of Aid relates;
      (c) the relationship between a person seeking legal advice and the Director and the solicitor (if any) who gives the advice.[6/2013]
    (2)  Despite anything in subsection (1), the privileges mentioned in that subsection are not to arise in relation to any information tendered to the Director concerning the property or income of the applicant for a Grant of Aid.
      [6/2013]
    (3)  Unless this Act or any regulations made under this Act otherwise provide, the rights conferred by this Act on a person receiving legal aid or advice (as the case may be) are not to affect the rights or liabilities of other parties to the proceedings or the principles on which the discretion of any court is normally exercised.

    (3)  Unless the regulations made under this Act otherwise provide, any sum remaining unpaid on account of a person’s contribution, in respect of any matter for which legal aid has been granted, is a first charge on any property that is recovered or preserved for that person in the proceedings connected to the matter, in favour of any fund established under this Act.

    (5)  The charge under subsection (3) does not prevent a court from allowing any damages or costs mentioned in subsection (4)(b) that are recovered by a person to be set off against any damages or costs awarded against that person, in any case where a solicitor’s lien for costs would not prevent the court from allowing that set off.
      [50/2018]
    (6)  The Director may, in the Director’s discretion, reduce any contribution, or waive or refund the whole or any part of any contribution, that a person is required to pay under subsection (1).
