    (11)  Despite anything in this section, the amount of an annual allowance made to a person for any year of assessment in respect of any expenditure must not in any case exceed what, apart from the writing off falling to be made by reason of the making of that allowance, would be the residue of that expenditure at the end of the person’s basis period for that year of assessment.
    (12)  For the purposes of subsection (1), where a person has incurred capital expenditure before 1 January 2006 on the purchase of an industrial building or structure (including the purchase of a leasehold interest therein of not less than 25 years) which has not previously been used by any person, the person is deemed to have incurred expenditure on the construction of that industrial building or structure equal to the cost of construction of that industrial building or structure or to the net price paid by the person for that industrial building or structure or the interest therein, whichever is less, if —
      (a) the person claiming the initial allowance by virtue of this subsection purchased the industrial building or structure or acquired the leasehold interest therein from the person who constructed that building or structure; and
      (b) no initial allowance has been granted under subsection (1) in respect of that industrial building or structure to the person who constructed that building or structure.
    (13)  For the purposes of subsection (1), where a person has incurred capital expenditure on or after 1 January 2006 on the purchase of an industrial building or structure which has not previously been used by any person, the person is deemed to have incurred expenditure on the construction of that industrial building or structure equal to the capital expenditure incurred by the person on the purchase of that industrial building or structure if —

      (b) no initial allowance has been granted under subsection (1) in respect of that industrial building or structure to the person who constructed that building or structure.
    (14)  Unless otherwise provided in this Act or the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act 1967, where, in the basis period for any year of assessment, the trade, for which purpose the industrial building is used, produces income that is exempt from tax as well as income chargeable with tax, the allowances for that year of assessment must be made against each income for that year of assessment in such proportion as appears reasonable to the Comptroller in the circumstances.
    (15)  Subject to section 18B, this section does not apply to any capital expenditure incurred on or after 23 February 2010 on the construction or purchase of an industrial building or structure.

      (a) on or before 22 February 2010 —(i)has been granted the option to purchase the land or has entered into a sale and purchase agreement for the land on which the industrial building or structure is to be constructed;(ii)has entered into a lease agreement to lease the land on which the industrial building or structure is to be constructed; or(iii)has submitted an application to the Government or any statutory board —(A)to bid for the purchase therefrom of the land on which the industrial building or structure is to be constructed; or(B)to lease therefrom the land on which the industrial building or structure is to be constructed; and

### 17. Balancing allowances and charges for industrial buildings and structures

    (1)  Where any of the events referred to in subsection (1A) occurs while a building or structure is an industrial building or structure or after it has ceased to be one and —
      (a) any capital expenditure has been incurred on the construction of the building or structure before 1 January 2006; or
      (b) either —(i)any capital expenditure has been incurred on the construction of the building or structure on or after 1 January 2006; or(ii)a sale and purchase agreement for the building or structure was entered into on or after that date,
        (i) any capital expenditure has been incurred on the construction of the building or structure on or after 1 January 2006; or (ii) a sale and purchase agreement for the building or structure was entered into on or after that date,
      then an allowance or a charge, to be known as a “balancing allowance” or a “balancing charge” is, in the circumstances mentioned in this section, to be made to or (as the case may be) on the person entitled to the relevant interest immediately before that event occurs for the year of assessment in the basis period for which that event occurs.
    (1A)  The events referred to in subsection (1) are —
      (a) the relevant interest in the building or structure is sold;
      (b) that interest, being a leasehold interest, comes to an end otherwise than on the person entitled thereto acquiring the interest which is reversionary thereon;
      (c) the building or structure is demolished or destroyed or, without being demolished or destroyed, ceases altogether to be used.
    (2)  In the case referred to in subsection (1)(a), no balancing allowance or balancing charge may be made to or on any person for any year of assessment by reason of any event occurring after the end of the fiftieth year after that in which the building or structure was first used.
    (3)  No balancing allowance may be made to any person —
      (a) on the sale of the relevant interest in the building or structure unless the person proves to the Comptroller’s satisfaction that the value of the building or structure to the person is less than —(i)in the case referred to in subsection (1)(a), the amount of the capital expenditure incurred on the construction of the building or structure reduced by the amount of any initial and annual allowances made (including an amount of 3% of the capital expenditure for each year in which no initial or annual allowance was made); or(ii)in the case referred to in subsection (1)(b), the amount of the capital expenditure incurred by the person on the construction or purchase of the building or structure (as the case may be) reduced by the amount of any initial and annual allowances made (including an amount of 3% of the capital expenditure for each year in which no initial or annual allowance was made); or
        (i) in the case referred to in subsection (1)(a), the amount of the capital expenditure incurred on the construction of the building or structure reduced by the amount of any initial and annual allowances made (including an amount of 3% of the capital expenditure for each year in which no initial or annual allowance was made); or (ii) in the case referred to in subsection (1)(b), the amount of the capital expenditure incurred by the person on the construction or purchase of the building or structure (as the case may be) reduced by the amount of any initial and annual allowances made (including an amount of 3% of the capital expenditure for each year in which no initial or annual allowance was made); or  (b) where the relevant interest in the building or structure is not sold but the building or structure is or would be redeveloped for any use other than as an industrial building or structure.
    (4)  Where there are no sale, insurance, salvage or compensation moneys, or where the residue of the expenditure immediately before the event exceeds those moneys, a balancing allowance is to be made and the amount thereof is the amount of the residue or (as the case may be) of the excess thereof over the moneys.
    (5)  If the sale, insurance, salvage or compensation moneys exceed the residue (if any) of the expenditure immediately before the event, a balancing charge is to be made and the amount on which it is made is an amount equal to the excess or, where the residue is nil, to the moneys.
    (6)  Despite anything in subsection (5) but subject to subsection (7), the amount on which a balancing charge is made on a person must not in any case exceed the aggregate of the following amounts:
      (a) the amount of the initial allowance (if any) made to the person in respect of the expenditure in question;
      (b) the amount of the annual allowances (if any) made to the person in respect of the expenditure in question.
    (7)  Unless otherwise provided in this Act or the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act 1967, where, in the basis period for any year of assessment, the trade, for which purpose the industrial building is used, produces income that is exempt from tax as well as income chargeable with tax, and any balancing allowance or balancing charge arises to be made —
      (a) the balancing allowance must be made against each income for that year of assessment in such proportion as appears reasonable to the Comptroller in the circumstances; and
      (b) such proportion of the balancing charge is exempt from tax as appears reasonable to the Comptroller in the circumstances.
    (8)  Where allowances have been made under both sections 16 and 18C in respect of any industrial building or structure, then, for the purposes of subsections (4) and (5), the sale, insurance, salvage or compensation moneys in respect of that building or structure is such amount of those moneys as the Comptroller determines to be reasonable in the circumstances.
    (9)  Where the relevant interest in a building or structure in respect of which allowances have been made under section 16 is transferred at less than the open‑market price, then for the purpose of determining the amount of any balancing charge under subsection (5), the relevant interest in the building or structure is treated as if it had been sold for an amount equal to the open‑market price of the building or structure as at the date of transfer.

### 20. Balancing allowances and charges for machinery or plant

    (1)  Except as provided in this section, where at any time after the setting up and on or before the permanent discontinuance of a trade, profession or business, any event occurs whereby machinery or plant in respect of which allowances under section 19 or 19A have been made to a person carrying on a trade, profession or business —
      (a) ceases to belong to that person (whether on a sale of the machinery or plant or in any other circumstances of any description); or
      (b) while continuing to belong to that person —(i)in a case where the machinery or plant which —(A)was provided for any research and development undertaken by that person directly in Singapore or by a research and development organisation on that person’s behalf in Singapore; and(B)was not provided for the purpose of a trade or business carried on by that person,permanently ceases to be used for any research and development undertaken by that person directly in Singapore or by a research and development organisation on that person’s behalf in Singapore, and is not used for the purpose of a trade, profession or business carried on by that person; or(ii)in any other case, permanently ceases to be used for the purpose of a trade, profession or business carried on by that person in Singapore (whether by reason of the discontinuance of the trade, profession or business, or discontinuance of use of such machinery or plant in a trade, profession or business which continues to be carried on in Singapore),
        (i) in a case where the machinery or plant which —(A)was provided for any research and development undertaken by that person directly in Singapore or by a research and development organisation on that person’s behalf in Singapore; and(B)was not provided for the purpose of a trade or business carried on by that person,permanently ceases to be used for any research and development undertaken by that person directly in Singapore or by a research and development organisation on that person’s behalf in Singapore, and is not used for the purpose of a trade, profession or business carried on by that person; or (A) was provided for any research and development undertaken by that person directly in Singapore or by a research and development organisation on that person’s behalf in Singapore; and (B) was not provided for the purpose of a trade or business carried on by that person, permanently ceases to be used for any research and development undertaken by that person directly in Singapore or by a research and development organisation on that person’s behalf in Singapore, and is not used for the purpose of a trade, profession or business carried on by that person; or (ii) in any other case, permanently ceases to be used for the purpose of a trade, profession or business carried on by that person in Singapore (whether by reason of the discontinuance of the trade, profession or business, or discontinuance of use of such machinery or plant in a trade, profession or business which continues to be carried on in Singapore),
      an allowance or a charge, to be known as a balancing allowance or a balancing charge, is in the circumstances mentioned in this section to be made to or (as the case may be) on that person for the year of assessment in the basis period for which that event occurs.
    (1A)  Where the property in machinery or plant passes at less than the open‑market price, then for the purpose of determining the amount of any balancing allowance or balancing charge the event is treated as if it had given rise to sale moneys of an amount equal to the open‑market price of the machinery or plant.
    (2)  Where machinery or plant continues to belong to that person after the date on which it permanently ceases to be used for the purposes of a trade, profession or business carried on by that person in Singapore, or (as the case may be) for the purpose of any research and development undertaken by that person directly in Singapore or by a research and development organisation on that person’s behalf in Singapore, it is deemed to have been sold on the date of permanent cessation of use at the open‑market price on that date.
    (2A)  Where there are no sale, insurance, salvage or compensation moneys or where the amount of the capital expenditure of the person in question on the provision of the machinery or plant still unallowed as at the time of the event exceeds those moneys, a balancing allowance is to be made, and the amount thereof is the amount of the expenditure still unallowed as aforesaid or (as the case may be) the excess thereof over those moneys.
    (3)  If the sale, insurance, salvage or compensation moneys exceed the amount (if any) of the said expenditure still unallowed as at the time of the event, a balancing charge is to be made, and the amount on which it is made is an amount equal to the excess or, where the said amount still unallowed is nil, to those moneys.
    (4)  Despite anything in subsection (3), the amount on which a balancing charge is made on a person must not in any case exceed —
      (a) the aggregate of the initial allowance (if any) and the annual allowances (if any) made to the person under section 19 in respect of the expenditure in question; and
      (b) the allowances (if any) made to the person under section 19A in respect of the expenditure in question.[27/2021]
    (5)  Despite anything in this section but subject to subsection (6A), where a balancing allowance or balancing charge falls to be made under subsection (1) in respect of a motor car to which section 19(3) applies, the sum to be taken in lieu of the open‑market price or sale, insurance, salvage or compensation moneys for the purpose of calculating such balancing allowance or charge is ascertained in accordance with the formula

      where Ais the open‑market price or sale, insurance, salvage or compensation moneys in respect of the motor car; andBis the capital expenditure incurred in respect of the motor car.
    (6)  Despite anything in this section, no balancing allowance may be made in respect of a motor car within the meaning of section 19(4)(a) which is not, for any basis period after the basis period for the year of assessment 1981, registered as a business service passenger vehicle for the purposes of the Road Traffic Act 1961.
    (6A)  Unless otherwise provided in this Act or the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act 1967, where, in the basis period for any year of assessment, the trade, profession or business, for which purpose the machinery or plant is provided, produces income that is exempt from tax as well as income chargeable with tax, and any balancing allowance or balancing charge arises to be made —
      (a) the balancing allowance is to be made against each income for that year of assessment in such proportion as appears reasonable to the Comptroller in the circumstances; and
      (b) such proportion of the balancing charge is exempt from tax as appears reasonable to the Comptroller in the circumstances.
    (6B)  Section 14C(4) and (5) applies in relation to the balancing allowance to be made to a person under subsection (1)(b)(i) as it applies in relation to the deduction of the expenditure and payments referred to in section 14C(1)(aa), (c) and (f), subject to the following modifications:
      (a) a reference to the amount of the expenditure or payments is a reference to the amount of the balancing allowance;
      (b) a reference to unabsorbed losses is a reference to unabsorbed allowances; and
      (c) a reference to a specified amount of the expenditure or payments is a reference to an amount computed in accordance with the formulawhere Ais the amount of the balancing allowance that could have been made against the income of the person under subsection (1)(b)(i) if the income had been subject to tax at the rate specified in section 43(1)(a);Bis the rate of tax specified in section 43(1)(a); andCis —(i)in a case where the concessionary income (as defined in section 14C(5)) derived by the person from the trade or business carried on by the person is subject to tax at a single concessionary rate of tax, that rate; or(ii)in a case where the concessionary income derived by the person from the trade or business carried on by the person is subject to tax at 2 or more concessionary rates of tax, the higher or highest of those rates.
         where Ais the amount of the balancing allowance that could have been made against the income of the person under subsection (1)(b)(i) if the income had been subject to tax at the rate specified in section 43(1)(a);Bis the rate of tax specified in section 43(1)(a); andCis —(i)in a case where the concessionary income (as defined in section 14C(5)) derived by the person from the trade or business carried on by the person is subject to tax at a single concessionary rate of tax, that rate; or(ii)in a case where the concessionary income derived by the person from the trade or business carried on by the person is subject to tax at 2 or more concessionary rates of tax, the higher or highest of those rates. where A is the amount of the balancing allowance that could have been made against the income of the person under subsection (1)(b)(i) if the income had been subject to tax at the rate specified in section 43(1)(a); B is the rate of tax specified in section 43(1)(a); and C is —  (i)in a case where the concessionary income (as defined in section 14C(5)) derived by the person from the trade or business carried on by the person is subject to tax at a single concessionary rate of tax, that rate; or (i)in a case where the concessionary income (as defined in section 14C(5)) derived by the person from the trade or business carried on by the person is subject to tax at a single concessionary rate of tax, that rate; or (i) in a case where the concessionary income (as defined in section 14C(5)) derived by the person from the trade or business carried on by the person is subject to tax at a single concessionary rate of tax, that rate; or  (ii)in a case where the concessionary income derived by the person from the trade or business carried on by the person is subject to tax at 2 or more concessionary rates of tax, the higher or highest of those rates.

(ii) in a case where the concessionary income derived by the person from the trade or business carried on by the person is subject to tax at 2 or more concessionary rates of tax, the higher or highest of those rates.
    (6C)  Despite anything in this Act or the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act 1967, where a balancing charge falls to be made on a person under subsection (1)(b)(i), the amount of the charge is deemed to be income of that person that is chargeable to tax at the rate of tax specified in section 43(1)(a).
    (7)  In this section, “open‑market price”, in relation to any machinery or plant, means the price which the machinery or plant would have fetched if sold in the open market at the time of the event in question; except that where the Comptroller is satisfied by reason of the special nature of any machinery or plant that it is not practicable to determine an open‑market price, the Comptroller may adopt such other value as appears to the Comptroller to be reasonable in the circumstances.

### 21. Replacement of machinery or plant

    (1)  Where machinery or plant in the case of which any of the events mentioned in section 20(1) has occurred is replaced by the owner thereof and a balancing charge falls to be made on the owner by reason of that event or, but for this section, would have fallen to be made on the owner by reason thereof, then, if by written notice to the Comptroller the owner so elects, this section has effect.
    (2)  If the amount on which the charge would have been made is greater than the capital expenditure on providing the new machinery or plant —
      (a) the charge is to be made only on an amount equal to the difference;
      (b) no initial allowance, no balancing allowance and no annual allowance may be made or allowed in respect of the new machinery or plant or the expenditure on the provision thereof; and
      (c) in considering whether any (and if so what) balancing charge falls to be made in respect of the expenditure on the new machinery or plant, there is deemed to have been made in respect of that expenditure an initial allowance equal to the full amount of that expenditure.
    (3)  If the capital expenditure on providing the new machinery or plant is equal to or greater than the amount on which the charge would have been made —
      (a) the charge must not be made;
      (b) the amount of any initial allowance in respect of the said expenditure is to be calculated as if the expenditure had been reduced by the amount on which the charge would have been made;
      (c) in considering what annual allowance is to be made in respect of the new machinery or plant, there is to be left out of account a proportion of the machinery or plant equal to the proportion which the amount on which the charge would have been made bears to the amount of the said expenditure; and
      (d) in considering whether any (and if so what) balancing allowance or balancing charge falls to be made in respect of the new machinery or plant, the initial allowance in respect thereof is deemed to have been increased by an amount equal to the amount on which the charge would have been made.
    (4)  This section does not apply to the provision of any new motor car for which no allowance is allowed by virtue of section 19(5).
    (5)  For the purpose of this section, where the capital expenditure incurred in providing, in the basis period for the year of assessment 2013 or any preceding year of assessment, a new motor car registered outside Singapore and used exclusively outside Singapore exceeds $35,000, the expenditure incurred is deemed to be $35,000.

    (2)  Where, for any period, the non‑resident person produces a certificate complying with subsection (3) —
      (a) the profits accruing in Singapore from the business for that period are deemed to be a sum bearing the same ratio to the sums receivable in respect of the carriage of passengers, mail, livestock and goods shipped in Singapore as the total profits for that period bear to the total sum receivable by the non‑resident person in respect of the carriage of passengers, mail, livestock and goods, as shown by the certificate; and
      (b) the depreciation allowable against such profits is similarly deemed to be a sum bearing the same ratio to the sums receivable in respect of the carriage of passengers, mail, livestock and goods shipped in Singapore as the total depreciation for that period bears to the total sum receivable by the non‑resident person in respect of the carriage of passengers, mail, livestock and goods, as shown by the certificate.
    (3)  The certificate referred to in subsection (2) —
      (a) must be one issued by or on behalf of the income tax authority of the place of residence of the non‑resident person;
      (b) is acceptable for the purposes of this section only where the Comptroller is satisfied that the relevant income tax authority —(i)computes and assesses the full profits of the non‑resident person from the non‑resident person’s shipping business on a basis not materially different from the basis of assessment provided by this Act for the assessment of a resident of Singapore carrying on a similar business; and(ii)accepts any certificate issued by the Comptroller for the purpose of computing the profits derived by a resident of Singapore from carrying on the business of a shipowner or charterer and assesses the income of that resident on the basis of and without making any adjustment to the profits or loss or the allowance for depreciation as stated in the certificate issued by the Comptroller and in the same manner as the income of the non‑resident person is assessed under subsection (2); and

        (i) the ratio of the profits or, where there are no profits, of the loss, as computed for the purposes of income tax by that authority, without making any allowance by way of depreciation, to the total sum receivable in respect of the carriage of passengers, mail, livestock and goods; (ii) the ratio of the allowance for depreciation as computed by that authority to that total sum receivable in respect of the carriage of passengers, mail, livestock and goods.

    (6)  Where the Comptroller decides that the call of a ship (within the meaning of section 2(1) of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995) belonging to a particular non‑resident shipowner or charterer at a port in Singapore is casual and that further calls by that ship or others in the same ownership are improbable, this section does not apply to the profits of that ship and no tax is chargeable on them.
      [2/2016]
    (7)  Despite anything in subsections (1) to (6), if in computing the profits derived by a resident in Singapore from carrying on the business of a shipowner or charterer, the tax authority of a foreign country determines such profits to be an amount which exceeds 5% of the full sum receivable on account of the carriage of passengers, mail, livestock and goods shipped in that foreign country, the Minister may if he or she thinks fit direct that, in computing the profits derived in Singapore by a non‑resident shipowner or charterer who is resident in that foreign country, the Comptroller must determine the amount of such profits in such manner as may be substantially similar to that adopted by the tax authority of that foreign country.

    (5)  Where under the terms of any settlement to which this section applies, any tax is charged on and paid by the person by whom the settlement is made, that person is entitled to recover from any trustee or other person to whom income is paid under the settlement the amount of the tax so paid, and for that purpose to require the Comptroller to furnish a certificate specifying the amount of tax so paid; and any certificate so furnished is conclusive evidence of the facts appearing therein.

    (2)  For the purpose of subsection (1), property is treated as having become trading stock if the property is held for sale or disposal in the ordinary course of a trade or business.

### 34A. Adjustment on change of basis of computing profits of financial instruments resulting from FRS 39 or SFRS for Small Entities

    (1)  Despite the provisions of this Act, the amount of any profit or loss (as the case may be) or expense to be brought into account for the basis period for any year of assessment in respect of any financial instrument of a qualifying person for the purposes of sections 10, 14, 14G and 37 is that which, in accordance with FRS 39 or SFRS for Small Entities (as the case may be), is recognised in determining any profit or loss (as the case may be) or expense in respect of that financial instrument for that year of assessment.
      [39/2017]
    (2)  Despite subsection (1), the profit or loss or expense in respect of the financial instrument referred to in the following paragraphs is, for the purposes of sections 10, 14, 14G and 37, to be computed as follows:
      (a) where a qualifying person to whom section 10(12)(b) applies derives interest from a negotiable certificate of deposit or derives a gain or profit from the sale thereof, the qualifying person’s income therefrom is treated in the manner set out in section 10(12);
      (b) where a qualifying person derives interest from debt securities or loans, and the interest is chargeable to tax under section 10(1)(d), such interest is to be computed based on the contractual interest rate and not the effective interest rate;[Act 33 of 2022 wef 04/11/2022]
      (c) any amount of profit or expense in respect of a loan for which no interest is payable is disregarded;

    (1)  Despite the provisions of this Act but subject to section 34G(3), (4) and (5), the amount of any profit, loss or expense to be brought into account for the basis period for any year of assessment in respect of any financial instrument of a qualifying person for the purposes of sections 10, 14, 14G and 37, respectively, is that which, in accordance with FRS 109 or SFRS(I) 9 (as the case may be), is recognised in determining any profit, loss or expense in respect of that financial instrument for that year of assessment.
      [39/2017; 45/2018]
    (2)  To avoid doubt, subsection (1) does not apply to anything recognised in accordance with FRS 109 or SFRS(I) 9 (as the case may be), that is capital in nature.

      (h) in a case where the qualifying person is a bank or qualifying finance company, the provisions in section 14G apply in relation to a provision made by the qualifying person for an expected credit loss arising from loans or securities that are not credit‑impaired, as those provisions apply in relation to a provision for doubtful debts arising from the person’s loans or for diminution in the value of the person’s investments in securities;
      (i) where an equity instrument on revenue account of a qualifying person that is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income is disposed of, an amount prescribed as the gain or loss to the qualifying person on such disposal, is chargeable to tax, or is to be allowed as a deduction;

    (4)  To avoid doubt, subsection (3)(d) does not affect the operation of section 34D.
      [39/2017]
    (5)  In a case where —
      (a) a loan on revenue account is transferred by a qualifying person (called in this subsection the transferor) to another person (called in this subsection the transferee);[Act 30 of 2023 wef 30/10/2023]
      (b) the transfer is not pursuant to a qualifying amalgamation within the meaning of section 34C(2) in relation to which an election is made under section 34C(4);
      (c) a provision for an expected credit loss arising from that loan that is credit‑impaired, being a loss that is recognised in accordance with FRS 109 or SFRS(I) 9 (as the case may be) in determining the profit or loss of such loan, is also transferred by the transferor to the transferee; and
      (d) a deduction of an amount in respect of the provision mentioned in paragraph (c) was previously allowed under section 14 (read with this section or section 34A) to the transferor,
      then, despite any provision in this Act —
      (e) in a case where both the transferor and the transferee are on the date of the transfer in the business of lending money, the deduction previously allowed to the transferor is treated, for the purposes of section 14, as having been allowed to the transferee under that section; and
      (f) in any other case, the provision for the expected credit loss mentioned in paragraph (c) that is transferred by the transferor and allowed a deduction under paragraph (d) is treated as a trading receipt of the transferor for the basis period in which the date of transfer falls.[39/2017; 45/2018][Act 30 of 2023 wef 30/10/2023]
    (6)  A person who is not a qualifying person under paragraph (a) or (b) of the definition of that term in subsection (15), may apply to the Comptroller for approval to be a qualifying person; and if the Comptroller approves the application, that person is a qualifying person starting from the year of assessment of the basis period in which the approval is granted or such later year of assessment as the Comptroller may approve.
      [39/2017]
    (7)  If —
      (a) any gain, loss or expense in respect of a financial instrument of a qualifying person to which subsection (1) applies is recognised under FRS 109 or SFRS(I) 9 (as the case may be) on a certain date;

      then, and despite anything in this Act but subject to subsection (9), the amount of the gain, loss or expense, together with the additional amount mentioned in subsection (8), is treated as the person’s income for the year of assessment within which the discovery time falls.
      [39/2017; 45/2018]
    (8)  The additional amount in subsection (7) is the amount of any other gain, loss or expense in respect of the same financial instrument —
      (a) that was not charged with tax, or for which a deduction was allowed, for one or more past years of assessment, for the same reason as that in subsection (7)(b); and
      (b) that is ascertained in accordance with the regulations made under subsection (13).[39/2017]
    (9)  For any qualifying person, no assessment may be made in respect of the income mentioned in subsection (7) more than 4 years immediately after the end of the year of assessment of the basis period in which the financial instrument is disposed of by the qualifying person.
      [39/2017]
    (10)  If —
      (a) any gain, loss or expense in respect of a financial instrument of a qualifying person to which subsection (1) applies is recognised under FRS 109 or SFRS(I) 9 (as the case may be) on a certain date;
      (b) it is not possible to determine, on the date the Comptroller makes an assessment of the amount of chargeable income of that person for the year of assessment of the basis period in which the date mentioned in paragraph (a) falls, whether that gain, loss or expense is capital or revenue in nature;
      (c) because of this, the gain was charged with tax or a deduction was not allowed for that loss or expense, as the case may be; and
      (d) the Comptroller later discovers (called the discovery time), with or without a claim made by the qualifying person, that the gain ought not to have been charged with tax as it is capital in nature, or a deduction ought to have been allowed for the loss or expense as it is revenue in nature, as the case may be,
      then, and despite anything in this Act but subject to subsection (12), the amount of the gain, loss or expense, together with the additional amount mentioned in subsection (11), is to be allowed as a deduction against the income of the person for the year of assessment within which the discovery time falls.
      [39/2017; 45/2018]
    (11)  The additional amount in subsection (10) is the amount of any other gain, loss or expense in respect of the same financial instrument —
      (a) that was charged with tax, or for which a deduction was not made, for one or more past years of assessment, for the same reason as that in subsection (10)(b); and
      (b) that is ascertained in accordance with the regulations made under subsection (13).[39/2017]
    (12)  For any qualifying person, no claim mentioned in subsection (10)(d) may be made more than 4 years immediately after the end of the year of assessment of the basis period in which the financial instrument is disposed of by the qualifying person.

    Transfer of property
    (9)  Where there is a transfer of property in respect of the transferred business from the transferor to the transferee on the effective date in respect of which allowances or writing-down allowances have been made to the transferor under sections 18C to 21 (other than section 19D), the transferor and the transferee are, subject to section 24(4), considered as having made an election under section 24(3), and section 24(3)(a) to (e) applies with the necessary modifications, whether or not —

    (11)  Where there is a transfer of a building or structure in respect of the transferred business from the transferor to the transferee on the effective date for which an allowance has been made to the transferor under section 18C, the annual allowances provided under that section continue to be available to the transferee as if the transferee had incurred the qualifying capital expenditure that was incurred in carrying out the approved construction or approved renovation (as the case may be) mentioned in that section.
    (12)  Subsection (11) does not apply unless the building or structure is used before the transfer by the transferor and after the transfer by the transferee, in the production of income chargeable under the provisions of this Act.
    (13)  Where —
      (a) there is a transfer of property in respect of the transferred business (being intellectual property rights in respect of which writing-down allowances have been made to the transferor under section 19B) from that transferor to the transferee on the effective date; and
      (b) before the transfer in the case of that transferor and from any time on or after the transfer in the case of that transferee, the property is used in the production of income chargeable under the provisions of this Act,

    (14)  Where there is a transfer of property in respect of the transferred business from the transferor to the transferee, being property on revenue account of the transferor but not on revenue account of the transferee, the consideration for the transfer of the property by the transferor is taken as the amount which it would have realised if the property had been sold in the open market on the effective date.
    (15)  The amount of consideration mentioned in subsection (14) is to be used to compute the gains or profits of the transferred business of the transferor and such gains or profits are chargeable to tax for the year of assessment which relates to the basis period in which the effective date falls.
    (16)  Where there is a transfer of property in respect of the transferred business from the transferor to the transferee, being property not on revenue account of the transferor but on revenue account of the transferee, the consideration for the acquisition of the property by the transferee is taken as the amount which it would have incurred if the property had been purchased in the open market on the effective date or the actual amount paid, whichever is lower.
    (17)  The amount of consideration mentioned in subsection (16) is to be deducted as an expense in computing the gains or profits of the transferred business of the transferee.
    (18)  Where the transferee ceases to carry on the transferred business in Singapore after the effective date but instead carries on that business outside Singapore, then in the case of intellectual property rights transferred pursuant to the transfer of that business and in respect of which subsection (13) applies, the charge under section 19B(4) or (5) (as the case may be) is to be made on the transferee as if the property has been sold on the date of cessation of the transferred business in Singapore; and for the purpose of computing the charge under section 19B(5), the value thereof is the amount which it would have realised if the property had been sold in the open market on the date of cessation of the transferred business in Singapore.
    (19)  Any question arising under subsections (14), (16) and (18) regarding the open market value attributable to property is to be determined by the Comptroller.
    (20)  No deduction under section 19B is allowed to the transferee for any intellectual property rights in respect of the transferred business that are recognised in accordance with FRS 38 and FRS 103, or with SFRS(I) 1‑38 and SFRS(I) 3, as a result of the transfer of the business but which were not in existence prior to the transfer of the business.
    (21)  Where the transferee continues to carry on the transferred business and at any time —

      (b) incurs an expenditure in respect of the transferred business, other than the expenditure to which prescribed sections of this Act apply; or
      (c) incurs a loss in respect of the transferred business,
      the transferee —

        (i) the transferor would have been allowed the deduction but for the transfer of the business; and (ii) the transferee is not otherwise allowed the deduction; and  (e) is chargeable to tax on the amount of the debt recovered or impairment loss that is reversed if —(i)the transferor would have been chargeable to tax on such amount but for the transfer of the business; and(ii)the transferee is not otherwise chargeable to tax on such amount.
        (i) the transferor would have been chargeable to tax on such amount but for the transfer of the business; and (ii) the transferee is not otherwise chargeable to tax on such amount.

      (d) the transferee is not otherwise chargeable to tax on such amount.
    (23)  Where the transferor has any capital allowance, donation or loss attributable or apportioned to the transferred business remaining unabsorbed on the effective date, then sections 23 and 37 apply, with the necessary modifications, as if the transferee is the transferor for the purposes of deducting the unabsorbed capital allowance, donation or loss against the income or the statutory income (as the case may be) of the transferee, subject to the conditions in subsection (24).

      (a) where the transferor was a qualifying person to which section 34AA applies (called in this subsection a section 34AA qualifying person) for the year of assessment of the basis period in which the effective date falls — the transferee is (unless the transferee was already one) deemed to be a section 34AA qualifying person for that year of assessment, and section 34AA has effect on the transferee from (and including) the effective date;
      (b) where the transferor was not a section 34AA qualifying person for the year of assessment of the basis period in which the effective date falls, but the transferee was a section 34AA qualifying person for that year of assessment — the regulations under section 34AA that provide for the transition of a person to the tax treatment under section 34AA have effect on the transferor for that year of assessment as if the transferor and transferee were a single section 34AA qualifying person, and any positive or negative adjustment which is not of a capital nature as a result of the application of such regulations is to be assessed on or allowed to the transferee;
      (c) where the transferor was a qualifying person to which section 34A applies (called in this subsection a section 34A qualifying person) for the year of assessment of the basis period in which the effective date falls — the transferee is (unless the transferee was already a section 34A qualifying person, or a section 34AA qualifying person, for that year of assessment) deemed to be a section 34A qualifying person for that year of assessment, and section 34A has effect on the transferee from (and including) the effective date; or
      (d) where the transferor was neither a section 34A qualifying person, nor a section 34AA qualifying person, for the year of assessment of the basis period in which the effective date falls, but the transferee was a section 34A qualifying person for that year of assessment — the regulations under section 34A that provide for the transition of a person to the tax treatment under section 34A have effect on the transferor for that year of assessment as if the transferor and the transferee were a single section 34A qualifying person, and any positive or negative adjustment which is not of a capital nature as a result of the application of such regulations is to be assessed on or allowed to the transferee.
    Transferee as qualifying company under section 43(6C)
    (27)  Where the transferee is a qualifying company for the purpose of section 43(6C) in any year of assessment, then, for that year of assessment —
      (a) in a case where the earlier of date A and date B does not fall within either of the basis periods of the first 2 years of assessment of the transferor, section 43(6) rather than section 43(6C) applies to the transferee; and
      (b) in a case where the earlier of date A and date B falls within either of the basis periods of the first 2 years of assessment of the transferor, section 43(6C) applies to the transferee if, and only if, the firstmentioned year of assessment falls within such period as may be prescribed by the Minister, and if it does not, then section 43(6) applies to the transferee.
    (28)  The Minister may, for different descriptions of transfers of businesses or companies, prescribe different periods for the purposes of subsection (27)(b).
    (29)  Starting on the effective date for the transferred business, the transferee must comply with all obligations, meet all liabilities, and is entitled to all rights, powers and privileges, of the transferor under this Act in respect of the business with respect to the year of assessment relating to the basis period in which the effective date falls, and all preceding years of assessment as if the transferee is the transferor.

    (18)  If the Comptroller is satisfied that the shareholders of the acquiring company on the first day of the year of assessment in which the deduction is to be allowed in respect of a qualifying acquisition are not substantially the same as its shareholders on the date of the acquisition of the shares, then no deduction in respect of the qualifying acquisition may be made to the acquiring company for the year of assessment relating to the basis period of the acquiring company in which the deduction is to be allowed and for any subsequent year of assessment.
    Modifications for groups of companies
    (19)  Where the acquiring company or the acquiring subsidiary (as the case may be) and the target company are part of the same group of companies on the date of a qualifying acquisition of ordinary shares in a target company by the acquiring company or the acquiring subsidiary (as the case may be), no deduction may be made under this section in respect of that qualifying acquisition unless the total number of ordinary shares acquired by the acquiring company or the acquiring subsidiary (as the case may be) results in an increase in the total number of ordinary shares of the target company held on that date by all companies in the group (excluding the target company) and, where there is such an increase —
      (a) a deduction is only allowed under this section for; and
      (b) references in subsections (7) to (10A) to any capital expenditure for a qualifying acquisition are accordingly references to,
      the capital expenditure in respect of the number of such shares that corresponds to such increase.
      [2/2016]
    (19A)  The Minister or such person as he may appoint may, for any particular qualifying acquisition made during the period from 17 February 2012 to 31 March 2020 (both dates inclusive), waive the requirement in subsections (16A)(d) and (17)(e) in relation to the ultimate holding company of the acquiring company, subject to such conditions that the Minister or the person he has appointed may impose.
      [2/2016; 41/2020]
    (19B)  If —
      (a) any requirement under subsections (16A)(d) and (17)(e) has been waived (whether before, on or after 2 December 2019) for an acquiring company in respect of any qualifying acquisition under subsection (19A); and
      (b) the acquiring company fails to comply with a condition subsequent imposed under subsection (19A) for such waiver,
      then, if the Minister or the person appointed by the Minister is satisfied, having regard to the acquiring company’s representation and all the relevant circumstances of the case, that it is just and reasonable to do so, the Minister or appointed person —
      (c) may make a determination that the company is not entitled to any deduction in respect of the qualifying acquisition for each year of assessment beginning with a specified year of assessment; and
      (d) must give a written notice of the determination to the Comptroller and the company.[32/2019]
    (19C)  If a determination has been made under subsection (19B), then (despite anything in this section) —
      (a) any deduction that has already been made to the acquiring company in respect of the qualifying acquisition for each year of assessment beginning with the specified year of assessment is treated for the purposes of this section as having been wrongly allowed, and the Comptroller may, subject to section 74, make an assessment or additional assessment on the company for those years of assessment to make good any tax shortfall; and
      (b) no deduction may be made to the company for the qualifying acquisition —(i)for any year of assessment after the year or years of assessment mentioned in paragraph (a); or(ii)if no deduction has been made to the company for the specified year of assessment, for the specified year of assessment and each subsequent year of assessment.[32/2019]
        (i) for any year of assessment after the year or years of assessment mentioned in paragraph (a); or (ii) if no deduction has been made to the company for the specified year of assessment, for the specified year of assessment and each subsequent year of assessment.[32/2019]
    Carry forward of deductions
    (20)  Subject to subsection (21), where in any year of assessment full effect cannot, by reason of an insufficiency of gains or profits chargeable for that year of assessment, be given to any deduction falling to be allowed under this section, the balance of the deduction is to be added to, and is deemed to form part of the corresponding deduction (if any) for the next succeeding year of assessment, and if no such corresponding deduction falls to be allowed for that year, is deemed to constitute the corresponding deduction for that year, and so on for subsequent years of assessment.
    (21)  No balance may be added to and be deemed to form part of the corresponding deduction (if any) to be given to an acquiring company under subsection (20) for a year of assessment unless the Comptroller is satisfied that the shareholders of the acquiring company on the last day of the year of assessment in which the deduction was claimed were substantially the same as the shareholders of the acquiring company on the first day of the firstmentioned year of assessment; and such balance must not be allowed in any subsequent year of assessment.
    Exemption
    (22)  The Minister or such person as the Minister may appoint may, where there is a substantial change in the shareholders of a company and the Minister or appointed person is satisfied that such change is not for the purpose of deriving any tax benefit or obtaining any tax advantage, exempt that company from the provisions of subsections (18) and (21).
    Deductions that ought not to have been allowed
    (23)  Despite section 74(1) and (4), where it appears to the Comptroller that a deduction or any part thereof under this section which has been allowed to any acquiring company in any year of assessment ought not to have been allowed by virtue of —
      (a) the occurrence of any event specified in subsection (17) or (18);
      (b) the failure of the acquiring company or the acquiring subsidiary (as the case may be) to pay the consideration for acquiring the shares of the target company in full within 6 months from the date of the acquisition of the shares or, in the case of consideration that is contingent consideration, within 6 months from the date the contingent consideration is incurred;
      (c) a reduction in the consideration paid in relation to the share acquisition upon satisfaction of indemnity conditions as may be specified in the agreement for the sale of the ordinary shares of the target company; or
      (d) section 33,
      the Comptroller may, at any time, for the purposes of making good any loss of tax attributable to the deduction or part thereof, assess the person who has utilised the deduction at such amount or additional amount as according to the Comptroller’s judgment ought to have been charged, and this subsection also applies with the necessary modifications to any assessment which results in any unabsorbed allowances or losses.
    Regulations
    (24)  The Minister may make regulations —
      (a) to provide for the disallowance of or for the adjustments to be made to the amount of any deduction allowed in any year of assessment under this section where the acquiring company or the acquiring subsidiary (as the case may be) divests itself of any of the ordinary shares it holds in the target company;
      (b) to provide for the application of this section to a business trust, subject to such modifications as may be prescribed, including treating, in prescribed circumstances, a business trust and any company whose shares are trust property thereof as companies within a group of companies, and a holding of units in a business trust as a holding of shares in a company;

      (a) may provide for liability to tax by one country and for exemption from tax by the other country;

### 50. Tax credits

    (1)  This section has effect where, under arrangements having effect under section 49, tax payable in respect of any income in the territory with the government of which the arrangements are made is to be allowed as a credit against tax payable in respect of that income in Singapore.
    (2)  The amount of the income tax chargeable in respect of the income is reduced by the amount of the credit; except that credit is not allowed against income tax for any year of assessment unless the person entitled to the income is resident in Singapore during that year.
    (3)  The credit must not exceed the amount which would be produced by computing the amount of the income in accordance with the provisions of this Act and then charging it to income tax at a rate ascertained by dividing the income tax chargeable (before allowance of credit under any arrangements having effect under section 49) on the assessable income of the person entitled to the income by the amount of the person’s assessable income.
    (4)  Without limiting subsection (3), the total credit to be allowed to a person for any year of assessment for foreign tax under all arrangements having effect under section 49 must not exceed the total income tax payable by the person for that year of assessment, excluding any tax payable by the person under section 45.
    (5)  In computing the amount of the income —
      (a) no deduction is allowed in respect of foreign tax (whether in respect of the same or any other income);
      (b) where the income tax chargeable depends on the amount received in Singapore, that amount is to be increased by the appropriate amount of the foreign tax in respect of the income; and
      (c) where the income includes a dividend and under the arrangements foreign tax not chargeable directly or by deduction in respect of the dividend is to be taken into account in considering whether any (and if so what) credit is to be given against income tax in respect of the dividend, the amount of the income is to be increased by the amount of the foreign tax not so chargeable that falls to be taken into account in computing the amount of the credit.
    (6)  Subsection (5)(a) and (b) applies to the computation of assessable income for the purposes of determining the rate mentioned in subsection (3), and applies to such computation in relation to all income in the case of which credit falls to be given for foreign tax under arrangements for the time being in force under section 49.
    (7)  Where —
      (a) the arrangements provide, in relation to dividends of some classes, but not in relation to dividends of other classes, that foreign tax not chargeable directly or by deduction in respect of dividends is to be taken into account in considering whether any (and if so what) credit is to be given against income tax in respect of the dividends; and
      (b) a dividend is paid that is not of a class in relation to which the arrangements so provide,
      then, if the dividend is paid to a company which controls, directly or indirectly, not less than one‑half of the voting power in the company paying the dividend, credit is to be allowed as if the dividend were a dividend of a class in relation to which the arrangements so provide.
    (8)  Credit is not allowed under the arrangements against income tax chargeable in respect of the income of any person for any year of assessment if the person elects that credit is not to be allowed in the case of the person’s income for that year.
    (9)  Any claim for an allowance by way of credit must be made not later than 2 years after the end of the year of assessment to which the claim relates (if the year of assessment is the year of assessment 2021 or a previous year of assessment), or 4 years after the end of the year of assessment to which the claim relates (if the year of assessment is any other year of assessment), and in the event of any dispute as to the amount allowable the claim is subject to objection and appeal in like manner as an assessment.
      [27/2021]
    (10)  Where the amount of any credit given under the arrangements is rendered excessive or insufficient by reason of any adjustment of the amount of any tax payable either in Singapore or elsewhere, nothing in this Act limiting the time for the making of assessments or claims for relief applies to any assessment or claim to which the adjustment gives rise, being an assessment or claim made not later than 3 years from the time when all such assessments, adjustments and other determinations have been made, whether in Singapore or elsewhere, as are material in determining whether any (and if so what) credit falls to be given.
      [27/2021]
    (11)  If the amount of any credit given under the arrangements to a person is rendered excessive by reason of any adjustment of the amount of any tax payable in any territory outside Singapore, the person must give the Comptroller a written notice of the particulars of the adjustment, in the manner specified by the Comptroller, within one year after the adjustment is made.
      [27/2021]
    (11A)  Any person who, without reasonable excuse, fails to comply with subsection (11) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a penalty not exceeding the amount of the excess credit under subsection (11).
      [27/2021]
    (11B)  The Comptroller may compound any offence under subsection (11A).

    (5)  The fact that a non‑resident person executes sales or carries out transactions with other non‑resident persons in circumstances which would make the non‑resident person chargeable pursuant to subsections (2A) and (3) in the name of a resident person does not of itself make the non‑resident person chargeable in respect of gains or profits arising from those sales or transactions.

### 73. Advance assessments

    (1)  Despite section 72, where —
      (a) in any year of assessment a person ceases to carry on a trade, business, profession, vocation or employment; or
      (b) the Comptroller is of the opinion that any person possessing a source of income is about to leave Singapore and is likely to cease to possess that source in the year of assessment in which the person leaves Singapore or in the following 2 years,
      the Comptroller may make such assessment or additional assessments as may be necessary to bring to charge the full amount of the income from all sources derived or to be derived by such person up to the year in which the source of income ceases or is likely to cease.
    (2)  Where the income of a person is ascertained under section 27, the Comptroller may make an assessment in respect of any income of such person within the year in which the income is deemed to accrue.

    (5)  If it appears to the Comptroller that by reason of such assumption an advance assessment so made has become less favourable to that person than it would have been if made under section 35(1), the Comptroller must amend such assessment as to the Comptroller seems reasonable.
