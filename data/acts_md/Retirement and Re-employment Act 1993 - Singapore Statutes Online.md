    (6)  Without affecting section 7B, where E2 enters into a contract of service with an eligible employee in lieu of E1, any period for which the eligible employee has served under E1 before he or she commences his or her service with E2 is to be reckoned only for the purposes of —
      (a) computing the minimum period of 3 months for entitlement to annual leave under section 88A(1) of the Employment Act 1968; and
