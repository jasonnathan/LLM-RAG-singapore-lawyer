      (e) the date on which the recipient receives the reimbursement of that amount,

      (c) the Comptroller is satisfied that the distantly taxable goods have been delivered or that the services have been performed (as the case may be), prior to that date,
      then the recipient may treat the reverse charge supply as taking place when the distantly taxable goods were delivered (to the extent of the delivery) or the services were performed (to the extent of the performance).

      (d) if the recipient makes such an election and ceases on any day in a longer period to be a taxable person (called in this paragraph the day of cessation), the reverse charge supplies of the recipient that would (but for this subsection) take place in the longer period but before the day of cessation, are treated as taking place on the day immediately before the day of cessation.[52/2018][Act 34 of 2021 wef 01/01/2022]

    (2)  Subject to this section, a taxable person is entitled at the end of each such period to credit for so much of the taxable person’s input tax as is allowable under section 20, and then to deduct that amount from any output tax that is due from the taxable person.
    (3)  Subject to subsection (4) —
      (a) “input tax”, in relation to a taxable person, means the following:(i)tax on the supply to the taxable person of any goods or services;(ii)tax on the reverse charge supply treated as made by the taxable person (as a recipient) to himself, herself or itself under section 14(2);(iii)tax paid or payable by the taxable person on the importation of any goods,being (in any such case) goods or services used or to be used for the purpose of any business carried on or to be carried on by the taxable person; and

    (4)  Where —
      (a) goods or services supplied to a taxable person;

      (c) goods imported by a taxable person,
      are used or to be used partly for the purposes of a business carried on or to be carried on by the taxable person and partly for other purposes, tax on supplies and importations must be apportioned so that only so much as is referable to the taxable person’s business purposes is counted as the taxable person’s input tax.
      [52/2018]
    (5)  Subject to subsections (5A), (6) and (7), if either no output tax is due at the end of the period, or the amount of the credit exceeds that of the tax, then, the amount of the credit or (as the case may be) the amount of the excess must be paid to the taxable person by the Comptroller.
      [20/2010]
    (5A)  In an accounting period —
      (a) where the tax accounted for by the taxable person pursuant to regulations made under section 27A is equal to or exceeds the amount of credit or excess referred to in subsection (5), the amount of the credit or excess is nil; and
      (b) where the tax accounted for is less than the amount of credit or excess, the amount of the credit or excess is the amount of the credit or excess less the amount of that tax.[20/2010]
    (6)  The whole or any part of the credit may, subject to and in accordance with regulations, be held over to be credited in and for a subsequent period; and the regulations may allow for it to be so held over either on the taxable person’s own application or in accordance with general or special directions given by the Comptroller from time to time.
    (7)  Where at the end of any period an amount is due under subsection (5) to a taxable person who has failed to submit returns, to comply with any reasonable request by the Comptroller for information or to pay tax or penalty for any period as required by this Act, the Comptroller may —

    (8)  No deduction may be made under subsection (2) nor any payment made under subsection (5), except on a claim made in the manner and within the time prescribed by regulations.
    (9)  In the case of a person who has made no taxable supplies in the period concerned or any previous period, payment under subsection (5) shall be made subject to conditions (if any) imposed by the Comptroller as the Comptroller thinks fit, including conditions as to repayment in specified circumstances.
    (10)  Subject to subsections (8) and (9), any payment due under subsection (5) must be paid within the time prescribed by regulations.
    (10A)  Where the Comptroller makes any payment under subsection (5), the Comptroller may deduct from the payment any expenses that the Comptroller may incur in making the payment.
      [52/2018]

    (12)  Except as the Comptroller otherwise allows, where —
      (a) a taxable person fails to pay the taxable person’s supplier the consideration or any part thereof for the supply of any goods or services made by the taxable person’s supplier to the taxable person; and
      (b) the taxable person has credited under subsection (2) the input tax to which the consideration or the part thereof which the taxable person failed to pay relates,
      the taxable person must account of an amount equal to such input tax —

      (d) in accordance with the method which the taxable person was required to use when the taxable person first credited the input tax,
      and the taxable person must repay such amount to the Comptroller at the same time as any tax in respect of the prescribed accounting period would be payable by the taxable person.
      [38/2005]
    (12A)  Where a taxable person —
      (a) has complied with subsection (12); and
      (b) during the subsequent specified period, pays the taxable person’s supplier the whole or part of the consideration for the supply of goods or services referred to in subsection (12)(a),
      the taxable person is entitled to treat an amount equal to the input tax relating to the payment referred to in paragraph (b) as if it were input tax for the prescribed accounting period during which the payment was made.
      [38/2005]
    (13)  The Minister may by regulations provide —
      (a) for tax on the supply of goods or services to a taxable person, or paid or payable by the taxable person on the importation of goods, to be treated as the taxable person’s input tax only if and to the extent that the charge to tax is evidenced and quantified by reference to such documents as may be specified in the regulations or as the Comptroller may direct either generally or in particular cases or classes of cases;
      (b) for a taxable person to count as the taxable person’s input tax, in such circumstances, to such extent and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed, tax on the supply to the taxable person of goods or services or paid by the taxable person on the importation of goods even though the taxable person was not a taxable person at the time of the supply or payment;
      (c) for a taxable person that is a body corporate to count as its input tax, in such circumstances, to such extent and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed, tax on the supply or importation of goods acquired for it before its incorporation or on the supply of services before that time for its benefit or in connection with its incorporation; and
      (d) in the case of a person who has been, but is no longer, a taxable person, for the person to be paid by the Comptroller the amount of any tax on a supply of services made to the person for the purposes of the business carried on by the person when the person was a taxable person.
    (14)  The Minister may by regulations provide, in relation to such supplies and importations as the regulations may specify, that tax charged on them or any part thereof is to be excluded from any credit under this section; and —
      (a) any such provision may be framed by reference to the description of goods or services supplied or goods imported, the person by whom they are supplied or imported or to whom they are supplied, the purposes for which they are supplied or imported, or any circumstances whatsoever; and
      (b) such regulations may contain provision for consequential relief from output tax.
    (14A)  For the purposes of this section, where a supply of any goods or intellectual property rights is made by way of a sale, lease or licence of any interest in or right over the goods or intellectual property rights to a bare trustee (with such interest or right to be held as a bare trustee), the supply to the bare trustee is treated as a supply made to the persons or person for whose business the bare trustee holds the interest or right.

      “initial specified period” means a period of 12 months after the due date for payment of the consideration or the part thereof (as the case may be) by the taxable person to the taxable person’s supplier;

### 20. Input tax allowable under section 19

    (1)  The amount of input tax for which a taxable person is entitled to credit at the end of any prescribed accounting period is so much of the input tax for the period (that is input tax on supplies and importations in the period) as is allowable by or under regulations as being attributable to supplies within subsection (2).
    (2)  The supplies within this subsection are the following supplies made or to be made by the taxable person in the course or furtherance of the taxable person’s business:

      (aa) supplies permitted to be made under section 27 or regulations made under section 27 without payment of the tax chargeable on the supplies;

      [42/2020]
    (2B)  For the purpose of subsection (2A), an arrangement to cause loss of public revenue is an arrangement comprising 2 or more supplies (whether or not the supplies are in the same chain of supply or in different chains of supply), the effect of which is that one or more persons evade or avoid paying any amount of tax, or is able to seek to obtain any credit for or refund of tax which the person or persons would not otherwise be able to obtain.
      [42/2020]
    (2BA)  In subsections (2A) and (2B) —
      (a) a supply includes a purported supply; and
      (b) a chain of supplies includes a chain of purported supplies, and a chain of supplies and purported supplies,

      [42/2020]
    (2D)  For the purposes of this Act, a taxable person should have known that a supply made to the taxable person was a part of an arrangement mentioned in subsection (2A) if —
      (a) the circumstances connected with the supply made to the taxable person or with a supply made by the taxable person, or both, carried a reasonable risk of the supply being a part of such arrangement; and
      (b) the taxable person, before making a claim for credit for the input tax on the supply to the person —(i)did not take reasonable steps to ascertain whether the supply was a part of such arrangement; or(ii)took reasonable steps to ascertain whether the supply was a part of such arrangement and —(A)concluded that the supply was not a part of such arrangement and the conclusion is not one that a reasonable person would have made;(B)was unable to conclude that the supply was not a part of such arrangement; or(C)did not make any conclusion as to whether the supply was or was not a part of such arrangement.[42/2020]
        (i) did not take reasonable steps to ascertain whether the supply was a part of such arrangement; or (ii) took reasonable steps to ascertain whether the supply was a part of such arrangement and —(A)concluded that the supply was not a part of such arrangement and the conclusion is not one that a reasonable person would have made;(B)was unable to conclude that the supply was not a part of such arrangement; or(C)did not make any conclusion as to whether the supply was or was not a part of such arrangement.[42/2020] (A) concluded that the supply was not a part of such arrangement and the conclusion is not one that a reasonable person would have made; (B) was unable to conclude that the supply was not a part of such arrangement; or (C) did not make any conclusion as to whether the supply was or was not a part of such arrangement.[42/2020]

      (b) subsection (2D) applies in a case mentioned in paragraph (b)(ii)(B) or (C) of that subsection even if a reasonable person would have concluded that the supply was not a part of an arrangement mentioned in subsection (2A).[42/2020]
    (2F)  To avoid doubt, where —
      (a) the taxable person took reasonable steps to ascertain whether the supply was a part of an arrangement mentioned in subsection (2A) and concluded that the supply was not a part of such arrangement; and
      (b) the conclusion is one that a reasonable person would have made,
      then, the person is not a person who should have known that the supply was a part of such arrangement, for the purposes of this Act.
      [42/2020]
    (2G)  The circumstances for the purposes of subsection (2D) include the following:
      (a) any of the supplies in question is not a supply which the taxable person would ordinarily enter into, given the nature and extent of the taxable person’s business;
      (b) the value of any of the supplies in question is substantially in excess of the value of the assets of the business carried on by the taxable person or the risks required to be borne by the taxable person for the supply;
      (c) the reasonableness or commerciality of any of the supplies in question is questionable, for instance, where there is a ready supplier to the taxable person and a ready buyer from the taxable person for the same goods or services in circumstances where the need for the taxable person as an intervening supplier is unnecessary;

      (b) where such supplies are made to a taxable person for the purpose of any business carried on by the taxable person; or

      (a) determining a proportion by reference to which input tax for any prescribed accounting period is to be provisionally attributed to those supplies;
      (b) adjusting, in accordance with a proportion determined in like manner for any longer period comprising 2 or more prescribed accounting periods or parts thereof, the provisional attribution for any of those periods; and
      (c) the making of payments in respect of input tax, by the Comptroller to a taxable person (or a person who has been a taxable person) or by a taxable person (or a person who has been a taxable person) to the Comptroller, in cases where events prove inaccurate an estimate on the basis of which an attribution was made.
    (5)  Without limiting subsection (4), regulations made under that subsection may —
      (a) make different provisions for different circumstances and, in particular, for different descriptions of goods or services; and
      (b) contain such incidental and supplementary provisions as appear to the Minister necessary or expedient.

      (a) where the change in the tax renders that supply liable to be charged with tax or increases the amount of any tax charged or chargeable in relation to that supply, the supplier may add to the agreed price in the contract the amount of that tax or the increase in that tax;
      (b) where the change in the tax renders that supply exempt from tax or reduces the amount of any tax charged or chargeable in relation to that supply, the supplier may deduct from the agreed price in the contract the amount of that tax or the reduction of that tax.

### 43. Production of tax invoices by computer

    (1)  For the purposes of any provision contained in or having effect under this Act which relates to tax invoices, a person is treated as issuing, or as providing another person with, a tax invoice if the requisite particulars are recorded in a computer and transmitted by electronic means and without the delivery of any equivalent document or counterpart in paper form.
    (2)  Any provision in this Act relating to tax invoices is treated as complied with by the production by means of a computer of any material other than a document in writing, by delivering any such material so produced or by making any such transmission as is mentioned in subsection (1) where the person producing or delivering the material or making the transmission and, in the case of delivered material or a transmission, the person receiving it has complied with such requirements as may be imposed by the Comptroller from time to time.

### 44. Giving of receipts

### 45. Power of Comptroller to assess tax due

    (1)  Where a person has failed to make any returns required under this Act or to keep any documents and afford the facilities necessary to verify such returns or where it appears to the Comptroller that such returns are incomplete or incorrect, the Comptroller may to the best of the Comptroller’s judgment assess the amount of tax due from that person and notify that person of it.
    (2)  In any case where —
      (a) an amount has been repaid to any person as being a repayment of tax, which ought not to have been repaid; or
      (b) an amount has been paid to any person as being due to the person in accordance with section 19(5), which ought not to have been paid to the person,
      the Comptroller may assess that amount as being tax due from the person for the prescribed accounting period in which the amount was repaid or (as the case may be) paid and accordingly notify the person of the assessment.
    (3)  Where a person is assessed under subsections (1) and (2) in respect of the same prescribed accounting period, the assessments may be combined and notified to the person as one assessment.
    (4)  Where the person failing to make a return, or making a return which appears to the Comptroller to be incomplete or incorrect, was required to make the return as a personal representative, trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, liquidator or person otherwise acting in a representative capacity in relation to another person, subsection (1) applies as if the reference to tax due from the person included a reference to a tax due from that other person.
    (5)  An assessment under subsection (1) or (2) of an amount of tax due for any prescribed accounting period must not be made —
      (a) in the case of a prescribed accounting period ending before 1 January 2007, more than 7 years after the end of the prescribed accounting period; and
      (b) in the case of a prescribed accounting period ending on or after 1 January 2007, more than 5 years after the end of the prescribed accounting period.[28/2007; 42/2020]
    (5A)  Despite subsection (5), where, in the opinion of the Comptroller, any form of fraud or wilful default has been committed by or on behalf of any person in connection with or in relation to tax, the Comptroller may for the purpose of making good any loss of tax or payment or refund of tax attributable to fraud or wilful default, make an assessment at any time.
    (6)  Where a taxable person has acquired or imported any goods in the course or furtherance of any business carried on by the taxable person, the Comptroller may require the taxable person from time to time to account for the goods.
    (6A)  If the taxable person fails to prove that —
      (a) the goods have been or are available to be supplied by the taxable person or have been exported from Singapore otherwise than by way of supply; or
      (b) the goods have been lost or destroyed,
      the Comptroller may assess to the best of the Comptroller’s judgment and notify the taxable person of the amount of tax that would have been chargeable in respect of the supply of the goods if they had been supplied by the taxable person.
    (7)  In any case where —
      (a) as a result of a person’s failure to make a return for a prescribed accounting period, the Comptroller has made an assessment under subsection (1) for that period;
      (b) the tax assessed has been paid but no proper return has been made for the period to which the assessment related; and
      (c) as a result of a failure to make a return for a later prescribed accounting period, being a failure by the person referred to in paragraph (a) or a person acting in a representative capacity in relation to the firstmentioned person, as mentioned in subsection (4), the Comptroller finds it necessary to make another assessment under subsection (1),
      then, if the Comptroller thinks fit, having regard to the failure referred to in paragraph (a), the Comptroller may specify in the assessment referred to in paragraph (c) an amount of tax greater than that which the Comptroller would otherwise have considered to be appropriate.
    (8)  Where it appears to the Comptroller that the amount which ought to have been assessed in an assessment under this section exceeds the amount which was so assessed, the Comptroller may —
      (a) under the same provision as that assessment was made; and
      (b) within the period during which that assessment could have been made,
      make a supplementary assessment of the amount of the excess and must notify the person accordingly.
    (9)  Where an amount has been assessed and notified to any person under subsection (1), (2), (6A) or (8), it is, subject to the provisions of this Act as to review and appeals, deemed to be an amount of tax due from the person and may be recovered accordingly, unless, or except to the extent that, the assessment has subsequently been withdrawn or reduced.
    (10)  The Comptroller may at any time make all such alterations in or additions to an assessment made under this section as the Comptroller thinks necessary to ensure the correctness thereof and notify the person accordingly.
    (10A)  Where the Comptroller raises an assessment under subsection (1) upon the failure of a person to make any returns, and, subsequent to such assessment, the person makes a return, the Comptroller may take into account the return and revise the assessment as the Comptroller deems fit.
      [28/2007]
    (10B)  For the purpose of subsection (10A), where a person makes a return in respect of a prescribed accounting period ending on or after 1 January 2007 more than 5 years after the end of the prescribed accounting period, the return is treated as not having been made.
      [28/2007; 42/2020]
    (11)  For the purposes of this section, notification to a personal representative, trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, liquidator or person otherwise acting in a representative capacity (each called a person acting in a representative capacity) is treated as notification to the person in relation to whom the person acting in a representative capacity so acts.

### 45A. Surcharge on supplies forming part of arrangements causing loss of public revenue

    (1)  Where —
      (a) a taxable person enters into a supply or purported supply that the taxable person should have known was a part of an arrangement mentioned in section 20(2A); and[Act 35 of 2022 wef 01/01/2023]
      (b) the taxable person makes a claim for credit for the input tax on the supply or purported supply,
      then, without affecting the power of the Comptroller to make an assessment under section 45(1) or (2) on the basis that the taxable person is not entitled to credit for the input tax because of section 20(2A), a surcharge equal to 10% of the amount of the input tax is imposed on the taxable person and is recoverable by the Comptroller from the taxable person as a debt due to the Government.
      [42/2020]
      [Act 35 of 2022 wef 01/01/2023]
    (2)  Nothing in this section prevents the applicability of section 20(2A) to a case, or any action of the Comptroller under subsection (1) in a case, from being questioned in an appeal against an assessment mentioned in subsection (1) in accordance with Part 8.
      [42/2020]
    (3)  Despite any objection under section 49 to or appeal under Part 8 lodged against an assessment of the Comptroller mentioned in subsection (1), the surcharge must be paid to the Comptroller —
      (a) within one month after the date a written notice of the surcharge is served in accordance with section 87(1) on the taxable person; and
      (b) in the manner stated in the notice.[42/2020]
    (4)  The Comptroller may, in the Comptroller’s discretion, and subject to any term and condition (including the imposition of interest on the surcharge) as the Comptroller may impose, extend the time within which the payment of the surcharge is to be made.
      [42/2020]
