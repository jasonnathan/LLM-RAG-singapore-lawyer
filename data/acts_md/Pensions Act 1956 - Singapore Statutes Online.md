    (4)  Where a person referred to in subsection (3) receives, in respect of some period of public service, both a gratuity and a pension, the amount of the pension is deemed, for the purpose of subsections (2) and (3), to be the amount of pension which would have been payable had the officer received a pension only and not a gratuity and a pension.
