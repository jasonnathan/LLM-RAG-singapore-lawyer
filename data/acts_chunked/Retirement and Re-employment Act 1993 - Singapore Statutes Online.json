and\n(b) the steps taken by the employer to re\u2011employ the employee.\n(11)The decision of the Minister on any representation made under this section is final.\n(12)Any direction of the Minister under subsection(6) operates as a bar to any action for damages by the employee in any court in respect of the unreasonable denial of re\u2011employment, or the dismissal of the employee without just cause or excuse, as the case may be.\n(13)An employer who fails to comply with the direction of the Minister under subsection(6) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding12months or to both.\n(14)Where any amount of compensation to be paid by an employer under subsection(6) is not paid in accordance with the direction of the Minister and the employer has been convicted of an offence under subsection(13), the amount or part thereof that remains unpaid is recoverable by the court as if it were a fine and the amount so recovered is to be paid to the employee entitled to payment under the direction of the Minister.\n(15)The Minister may, by writing under the hand of the Minister, delegate all or any of the Minister\u2019s powers under this section (except the power of delegation conferred by this section) to any public officer.\n(16)A delegation under subsection(15) is revocable at will and no delegation prevents the exercise of any power under this section by the Minister.\n(17)A power so delegated, when exercised by the delegate, is for the purposes of this section deemed to have been exercised by the Minister.",
