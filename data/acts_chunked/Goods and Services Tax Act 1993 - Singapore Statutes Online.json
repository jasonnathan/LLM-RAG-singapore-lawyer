or\n(c) in other prescribed circumstances.\n(4)The Minister may make regulations for securing a fair and reasonable attribution of input tax to supplies within subsection(2), and any such regulations may provide for\u2014\n(a) determining a proportion by reference to which input tax for any prescribed accounting period is to be provisionally attributed to those supplies;\n(b) adjusting, in accordance with a proportion determined in like manner for any longer period comprising 2 or more prescribed accounting periods or parts thereof, the provisional attribution for any of those periods; and\n(c) the making of payments in respect of input tax, by the Comptroller to a taxable person (or a person who has been a taxable person) or by a taxable person (or a person who has been a taxable person) to the Comptroller, in cases where events prove inaccurate an estimate on the basis of which an attribution was made.\n(5)Without limiting subsection(4), regulations made under that subsection may\u2014\n(a) make different provisions for different circumstances and, in particular, for different descriptions of goods or services;
